## Features

### Core

- **1800+ emotes** organized by category with **silhouette icons** (Emotes, Props, Dances, Shared, Expressions, Walk Styles, Animals, Emojis)
- **Real-time search** with instant filtering across all emotes
- **Two layout modes** — *Default* (classic panel) and *Cinematic* (transparent, immersive overlay)
- **Left or right positioning** — configurable panel side
- **Draggable menu** — click and drag the header to reposition (default layout)
- **Fully responsive** — optimized breakpoints for 720p, 1080p, 1440p, 4K, and ultrawide monitors (21:9, 32:9)

### Organization

- **Favorites** system with import/export (JSON) and drag-to-reorder
- **Recent emotes** — automatically tracks your last played emotes
- **Top emotes** — ranked by play count
- **Custom lists** — create personal collections with custom names and colors
- **Category filters** — filter by Props, Shared, or browse All
- **Sorting** — A-Z, Z-A, or by category

### Quick Access

- **Quick Bind** — assign emotes to NUM1-NUM6 keys via right-click drawer
- **Emote Wheel** — hold-to-peek radial selector (up to 8 slots, no cursor needed)
- **Keyboard navigation** — arrow keys + Enter to browse and play emotes
- **Random emote** button for spontaneous fun

### Playback

- **Emote preview** — see the animation on your ped before committing (solo, invisible to others)
- **Playlist system** — queue multiple emotes in sequence with play/stop/clear controls
- **Shared emote popup** — inline accept/decline for sync emote invitations
- **Partner finder** — locate nearby players for shared animations
- **Remember State** — menu remembers your scroll position, tab, and filters after playing an emote (resets on ESC/X, configurable)

### Reliability

- **Auto-close on death** — the menu closes itself if the player ped dies while it is open, avoiding stuck UI during the respawn / death camera
- **Version Check** — notifies server owners in console when a new release is available on GitHub
- **Resource Name Guard** — prevents the resource from starting if the folder is renamed (avoids silent breakage)

### Permissions & Security

- **Job-locked emotes** — restrict specific emotes to certain jobs (police, mechanic, medic, etc.)
- **Multi-framework support** — auto-detects ESX, QBox, QBCore, or standalone

### Ecosystem

- **MBT Meta Clothes** integration — detects and connects with `mbt_meta_clothes`
- **MBT Wearable Props** integration — detects and connects with `mbt_wearable_props`

### Localization

Built-in translations for **6 languages**: English, Italian, Spanish, French, German, Portuguese. Add your own by creating a new file in the `locales/` folder.

## Configuration

All configuration is done in `config.lua`. Here's an overview of each section:

### General

```lua
MBT.Language = 'en'           -- 'en', 'it', 'es', 'fr', 'de', 'pt'
MBT.Debug = false             -- Enable debug logs
MBT.RpemotesResource = nil    -- Auto-detect or force: 'rpemotes-reborn', 'rpemotes', 'rp-emotes'
```

### Menu

```lua
MBT.Menu = {
    Keybind            = 'F4',
    Command            = 'mbt_emotes',
    Layout             = 'cinematic',    -- 'default' or 'cinematic'
    Position           = 'right',        -- 'left' or 'right'
    CloseOnPlay        = true,
    RememberState      = true,           -- Remember scroll/tab/filters after playing (resets on ESC/X)
    Watermark          = true,
    OverrideNativeMenu = true,           -- Replaces rpemotes' NativeUI menu
}
```

### Features

```lua
MBT.Features = {
    Favorites    = true,
    RecentEmotes = true,
    MaxRecent    = 12,
    QuickBind    = true,
    SharedPopup  = true,
    PreviewPed   = true,
    EmoteWheel   = true,
}
```

### Emote Wheel

```lua
MBT.EmoteWheel = {
    Key       = 'H',   -- Hold to open
    Slots     = 8,     -- Max 8 slots
    RemoveKey = 'X',   -- Remove emote from current slot while wheel is open
}
```

### Theme

```lua
MBT.Theme = {
    Accent     = '00fb8a',   -- Primary accent color
    Background = '0C0E14',
    Card       = '141720',
    Text       = 'E8E8EE',
    SubText    = '6B7280',
    Border     = '1A1D26',
}
```

### Job Permissions

```lua
MBT.JobPermissions = {
    Enabled   = true,
    Framework = 'auto',    -- 'auto', 'esx', 'qbox', 'qbcore', 'standalone'
    Emotes = {
        ['handcuff'] = { 'police', 'sheriff' },
        ['mechanic'] = { 'mechanic', 'bennys' },
    },
}
```

### Categories

Toggle visibility or reorder categories in the menu:

```lua
MBT.Categories = {
    { type = 'Emotes',       label = 'Emotes',      icon = 'smile',      visible = true },
    { type = 'PropEmotes',   label = 'Props',        icon = 'package',    visible = true },
    { type = 'Dances',       label = 'Dances',       icon = 'music',      visible = true },
    { type = 'Shared',       label = 'Shared',       icon = 'users',      visible = true },
    { type = 'Expressions',  label = 'Expressions',  icon = 'drama',      visible = true },
    { type = 'Walks',        label = 'Walk Styles',  icon = 'footprints', visible = true },
    { type = 'AnimalEmotes', label = 'Animals',      icon = 'dog',        visible = true },
    { type = 'Emojis',       label = 'Emojis',       icon = 'message-circle', visible = true },
}
```

### Debug

When `MBT.Debug = true`, detailed logs are printed in both server console and client F8 console (including the NUI frontend via `[MBT NUI]` prefix). Useful for troubleshooting emote loading and KVP storage.

### Notifications

The notification function in `config.lua` supports presets for **ox_lib**, **ESX**, **QBCore**, **QBox**, and native GTA notifications. Uncomment the preset that matches your server setup.

## FAQ

**Q: Can I use this without rpemotes-reborn?**
No. This resource is a UI replacement that depends on rpemotes-reborn for all animation logic and emote data.

**Q: Does it work with ESX, QBox, and QBCore?**
Yes. The job permission system auto-detects your framework (ESX → QBox → QBCore → standalone). You can also force a specific one in config.

**Q: How do I add a new language?**
Create a new file in `locales/` (e.g., `locales/jp.lua`), copy the structure from `en.lua`, translate the strings, and set `MBT.Language = 'jp'` in config.

**Q: My emotes don't show up.**
Make sure `rpemotes-reborn` is started and running before `mbt_emote_menu`. Check the F8 console for errors.

**Q: The menu looks wrong on my ultrawide monitor.**
The UI includes responsive breakpoints for all common resolutions including 2560x1080, 3440x1440, and 5120x1440. If you still experience issues, please open an issue with your resolution.
